# Project10X-Calculus

> Learn Calculus by building 10 hands-on, visual, and interactive projects inspired by key topics in single and multivariable calculus, with applications to machine learning.

## About

This repository documents my personal journey to master Calculus through building 10 carefully chosen projects. Instead of memorizing rules and formulas, I focus on simulating, visualizing, and applying key calculus concepts — from limits and derivatives to multivariable functions and optimization.

These projects are designed with an ML context in mind, where calculus concepts show up in things like optimization, backpropagation, and function approximation.

This is part of my broader learning method called **Project10X**, and follows the same philosophy I used in my [Project10X-Stats](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-Stats.git), [Project10X-LinearAlgebra](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-Linear-Algebra.git), and [Project10X-The-Backend-Builder-Series](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-The-Backend-Builder-Series.git) repositories.

## How To Use This Repository

Each project lives in its own folder and includes:

- A local README explaining the concept, implementation, and results  
- Python code for visualization and computation  
- Simulations and outputs to help reinforce the math  

To get started with a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-Calculus.git
cd Project10X-Calculus/Project1-LimitsAndContinuity
````

Each README includes step-by-step breakdowns of what I’m doing and why, so others can learn alongside me.
